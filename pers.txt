Do not use i++ in recursion

Do remeber factorial and its listing condition

Hashing in Java:-

  HashMap<Integer, Integer> hmap = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();  Declaration
  hmap.put(arr[0], 1);  Here 1 is key of array[0]
  hmap.get(arr[0]); Throough this we will get array value which is present in 0th position
