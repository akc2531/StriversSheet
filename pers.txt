Do not use i++ in recursion

Do remeber factorial and its listing condition

Hashing in Java:-

  HashMap<Integer, Integer> hmap = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();  Declaration
  hmap.put(arr[0], 1);  Here 1 is key of array[0]
  hmap.get(arr[0]); Throough this we will get array value which is present in 0th position


Sorting in java:---
1)Selection Sort :- Firts we will select first element which is present at first index that is 0 and then compare with all its value and find out smallest or largest and then swap values accordingly and after that pointer will be at second index that is 1 and we will select then all the values and search for corresponding smallest or largest according and the process will continue so on ......

2)Bubble Sort :-  
In bubble sort algorithm, array is traversed from first element to last element. Here, current element is compared with the next element. If current element is greater than the next element, it is swapped.

3)Insertion Sort :-
We can create a java program to sort array elements using insertion sort. Insertion is good for small elements only because it requires more time for sorting large number of elements.

To sort an array of size N in ascending order iterate over the array and compare the current element (key) to its predecessor, if the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the elements before. Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element.

Java to remoove duplicate elements in java:---

The issue with your code is that you are modifying the ArrayList (`arr`) while iterating through it, and this can lead to unexpected behavior. When you remove an element from the ArrayList, it shifts the indices of the elements to the right of the removed element. As a result, you may skip checking some elements or encounter an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

ArrayList:---

If there is Array given int[] gg(int arr[])
1)We have to declare package import java.util.ArrayLsit;
2)We have to write List a=Arrays.asList(arr);
3)Now we have converted to List

To avoid this issue and correctly remove duplicates from the ArrayList, you should iterate through the ArrayList in reverse order. Here's a modified version of your code:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Solution {
    public static int removeDuplicates(ArrayList<Integer> arr, int n) {
        for (int i = arr.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                if (arr.get(i).equals(arr.get(j))) {
                    arr.remove(i);
                    break; // Exit the inner loop after removing the duplicate
                }
            }
        }
        return arr.size();
    }
}
```

In this modified code:

1. We iterate through the ArrayList in reverse order to avoid index shifting issues.
2. When we find a duplicate, we remove it from the ArrayList and then exit the inner loop using `break`.

This should correctly remove duplicates from the ArrayList without causing unexpected behavior, and it will return the expected output.
